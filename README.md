"Sucker" [7DRL 2014]

C++ with SDL

A puzzley roguelike. You are a dude with a vacuum machine,
going round old space ships looking for treasure. It's kind 
of like Spelunky but roguelike and not platformy. There's 
someone to rescue on each level, treasure and items that 
change gameplay. You get a score and that's the important part.
You don't go up levels or get stronger and neither do the mobs.

There are 10 levels. On each level there's someone to rescue, 
treasure, items, key for the exit. (Why can't you go back the way
you came in? OH NOES THAT'S BAD WRITING!) Maybe it's a space ship
with multiple decks (that all happen to have a different outside 
shape? I think not).

Anyway that's that.
